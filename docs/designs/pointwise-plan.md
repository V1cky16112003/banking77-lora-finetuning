# Pointwise — Implementation Plan

Companion to `pointwise-architecture.md`. Hardware: Kaggle T4 (fp16, ~30 GPU-h/week).
Each phase ends with a measurable gate; don't start the next phase until it passes.
Revised 2026-10-04 after comparison with Kev (architecture §8): pointer-head
read-out instead of slot tokens, TypeSafe's real API contract, re-derived
speed and calibration gates.

## Phase 0 — Logit read-out on Banking77 (done, gate re-scoped)
Goal: prove "decide without generating" on the existing pipeline.
- `src/readout.py`: score each of the 77 labels by its **full-sequence**
  log-likelihood (label tokens + EOS), renormalised over the label set.
  First-token scoring, the original idea, can't tell apart labels that share
  a first token (details in `pointwise-phase0-plan.md`).
- Reuse the existing LoRA checkpoint; compare against `generate()` + `parse_label`.
- Add `ece`, `brier`, `aurc`, `coverage_at` to `src/evaluate_core.py` (+ tests).
- **Gate:** read-out accuracy within 1 pt of generation (PASS: 0.918 vs 0.914);
  ECE reported (PASS: 0.021). Speed (≥5× faster) FAILED at 0.50×. Phase 0c
  profiles why. The speed gate is re-derived in Phase 2, because a read-out
  still has to put all 77 options in the input (`pointwise-phase0c-plan.md`).

Learn: why reading logits gives a probability distribution for free.

## Phase 1 — Shared-prefix parallel questions (≈2 days)
Goal: one state, many questions, one prefill.
- Bump `transformers` on the `jev` branch to a version with Qwen3 (≥ 4.51);
  keep `main`'s pin. Re-run the Phase 0 tests on the new version.
- `src/pointwise/packing.py`: build packed sequence + block attention mask +
  restarted position ids (state, then k question branches). Additive mask with
  `finfo.min`, padded query rows keep their diagonal (as Kev's `branch_mask_batch`).
- Row form: each question as one causal row continuing a cached state;
  rows per pass capped by a token budget.
- Unit tests: packed logits == logits from k separate "state + Qi" runs
  (atol 1e-3); row form == packed form.
- Benchmark on T4: k = 1, 4, 16, 64 questions; compare vs k separate calls.
- **Gate:** equivalence tests pass; latency grows sub-linearly in k.

Learn: KV caching, attention masks, why context budget = state + longest question.

## Phase 2 — Pointer head & the `/v1/systemone` API (≈3 days)
- Delimiters: reuse existing Qwen special tokens for state / question /
  option open / option close / decide; no new embedding rows.
- `src/pointwise/schema.py`: pydantic `Choice`, `Noul`, `Score`,
  `SystemOneRequest` matching TypeSafe's `/v1/systemone` (questions keyed by
  id; choice criteria `{name: description}`; score criteria = ordered list);
  `render()` for object/array states; TypeSafe's confidence formulas; 4-decimal
  rounding (architecture §2).
- `src/pointwise/model.py`: `PointerHead` (`W_q`, `W_k`, `d_p = 256`, fp32),
  reading `<decide>` against each option's closing-token hidden state; masked
  softmax per question; temperature applied only in eval mode.
- Escape `<|…|>` in all caller text before tokenising.
- Tests: answer always within declared options; probs sum to 1; a state or
  option containing a delimiter string cannot add an option; one question's
  text is invisible to its siblings; option-order flip rate (after training).
- **Gate:** API works end-to-end on the untrained model (random but well-typed);
  isolation and boundary-forgery tests pass. Speed, on a ~520-token state with
  1..8 short questions: each extra question costs ≤ 25% of a one-question
  request. A Banking77-shaped request (15-token message, one 77-option
  question, ~480 tokens) is reported next to generation, not gated: there the
  options dominate the input, so sharing the state can't help.
  *(Revised 2026-10-05: the earlier wording gated the extra-question cost on
  77-option questions, which can't pass by construction.)*

## Phase 3 — Training data (≈4 days)
Revised 2026-10-06 after checking the source list against Kev's training data
(details and reasoning in `pointwise-phase3-plan.md`).
- `src/pointwise/data/`: converters → `{request, targets}` JSONL, where `request`
  is a `/v1/systemone` request and `targets` a probability vector per question.
- **Train sources:** MNLI, BoolQ, AG News (capped), SST-5, Yelp (capped),
  CLINC150 minus its banking and credit-card domains and any intent named like a
  Banking77 label, multiple-choice QA (ARC, OpenBookQA, CommonsenseQA), and a
  rule-based policy generator (JSON/prose records, several questions each,
  labels computed by code).
- **Why multiple-choice QA:** every other source has a fixed label set, which a
  model can learn without reading the options. Varied option texts force the
  pointer head to read them, which zero-shot Banking77 depends on.
- **Held out (eval only):** Banking77 (zero-shot), QNLI, PAWS, Emotion,
  TweetEval sentiment. ChaosNLI (calibration vs human disagreement) moves to
  Phase 5; it exists only as an unofficial CC BY-NC mirror.
- Augment: random option subsets, shuffled option order (never for ordered
  Score levels), paraphrased instructions, JSON vs prose state, derived extra
  questions (1–8 per state).
- No paid teacher set in v1: the policy generator covers Jev-shaped requests
  with exact labels at no cost.
- Training context to start: state ≤ 384, question branch ≤ 1024, packed ≤ 2048.
- **Gate:** ≥200k train questions; label-distribution report including where
  the gold option sits (must be ~uniform); no Banking77 text, no excluded CLINC
  intent, no train/eval text overlap (tests assert the checks).

## Phase 4 — RLCD-lite training (2 Kaggle sessions)
Revised 2026-10-06 (details: `pointwise-phase4-plan.md`).
- `src/pointwise/train.py`: LoRA (r=16, attention + MLP) on Qwen3-1.7B Base,
  fp16 backbone with fp32 LoRA, head and loss; loss = log score (soft CE),
  optional Brier term; DDP over both T4s; gradient checkpointing.
- Kaggle-proof: stops itself before the 12h limit (a timed-out session keeps no
  output), checkpoints every 30 min, resumes from the previous notebook version
  attached as input, LR schedule sized from measured step time over 21 planned hours.
- **One main run**, not the 2×2 matrix: the weekly quota (~29h left) fits two
  ~11h sessions plus Phase 5 evaluation. The "SFT cross-entropy baseline" arm
  is dropped: with one-hot targets the log score *is* cross-entropy, so it
  would repeat the main run. Brier and permutation-KL variants wait for a
  later quota week.
- Fit temperature T on dev; store it with the results.
- **Gate:** on held-out out-of-domain sources (QNLI, PAWS, Emotion, TweetEval),
  ECE ≤ 0.05 after temperature scaling, and accuracy clearly above chance per
  source. Report raw ECE, T, and zero-shot Banking77 accuracy (not gated).

Learn: proper scoring rules — why the optimum of log score and Brier is the
true distribution, and why one-hot training still ends up overconfident.

## Phase 5 — Evaluation report (≈2 days)
- Zero-shot Banking77 (never trained on) vs the repo's fine-tuned classifier
  and vs Kev-0.8B / Kev-4B (open weights, same API).
- No-training baseline (SemIf-style): Qwen3-1.7B Base with no LoRA and no
  pointer head, scoring each option by full-sequence log-likelihood as in
  `src/readout.py`, renormalised over the candidate set. Same eval sets,
  prompts and candidates as Pointwise, so the gap is what fine-tuning adds.
  Report accuracy, raw ECE and ECE after its own fitted T per source, with
  paired bootstrap CIs on the accuracy gap.
- Reliability diagrams (raw and after T), risk–coverage curves, Cov@5%,
  option-shuffle flip rate.
- Latency table on T4: Pointwise vs generate-and-parse, k questions per state.
- Write `reports/pointwise-results.md`.
- **Gate:** report shows where Pointwise wins and loses, with bootstrap CIs,
  including against the no-training baseline.

## Phase 6 — Serving (≈2 days)
- Extend `src/serve.py` with `POST /v1/systemone`, request/response exactly as
  `schema.py` (TypeSafe's contract), so a Jev or Kev client works unchanged.
- State-prefix cache: reuse a state's KV across requests with the same state.
- Optional: vLLM prefix caching path for throughput.
- **Gate:** p95 latency < 150 ms for 1 state + 8 questions on T4.

## Phase 7 — Stretch
- RLCD stage 2 with rationales (OpenJev Algorithm 1) on a reasoning task.
- >255 options via 2-stage Noul scoring → Choice.
- Option isolation (permutation-invariant option spans, packed form).
- Qwen3-4B backbone.

## Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Pointer head learns option-position bias | Shuffle options, permutation-KL term, measure flip rate; option isolation in Phase 7 |
| Pinned transformers 4.46 can't load Qwen3 | Bump on `jev` in Phase 1; Phase 0 tests already run on 4.46 and 5.x |
| Speed gain over generation smaller than hoped | Gate on marginal cost per extra question, where shared prefill pays off |
| T4 fp16 overflow | Qwen3 (not Gemma); head and loss in fp32; grad clipping |
| Kaggle quota | Small run matrix; resume checkpoints; short eval sets during dev |
| Teacher cost | Teacher set is optional; real datasets alone suffice for v1 |
| Overclaiming vs Jev | Report results as "Pointwise", never as Jev parity; compare against Kev, which has open weights |

## Out of scope
Pre-training, multimodal input, multi-label outputs, matching Jev's benchmark claims.
